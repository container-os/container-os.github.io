      <description>Linux kernel release 4.x http://kernel.org/
These are the release notes for Linux version 4. Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong.
WHAT IS LINUX?
Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.</description>

      <description>Please see the LICENSE file for details on copying and usage. Please refer to the INSTALL file for instructions on how to build.
What is busybox:
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities you usually find in bzip2, coreutils, dhcp, diffutils, e2fsprogs, file, findutils, gawk, grep, inetutils, less, modutils, net-tools, procps, sed, shadow, sysklogd, sysvinit, tar, util-linux, and vim.</description>

      <description>libostree New! See the docs online at Read The Docs (OSTree)
This project is now known as &amp;ldquo;libostree&amp;rdquo;, though it is still appropriate to use the previous name: &amp;ldquo;OSTree&amp;rdquo; (or &amp;ldquo;ostree&amp;rdquo;). The focus is on projects which use libostree&amp;rsquo;s shared library, rather than users directly invoking the command line tools (except for build systems). However, in most of the rest of the documentation, we will use the term &amp;ldquo;OSTree&amp;rdquo;, since it&amp;rsquo;s slightly shorter, and changing all documentation at once is impractical.</description>
